"""The :py:mod:`~.parfile` module provides functions to programmatically write
parameter files. The main functions provided are:

- :py:func:`~.write_one_parfile_from_template`. This function takes a Python
  string template, a dictionary with the instructions to perform the
  substitution, and the name of the file where to write the output.
- :py:func:`~.write_many_parfiles_from_template`. This function calls the
  previous function (:py:func:`~.write_one_parfile_from_template`) multiple times
  on a multiple substitution lists to produce multiple files.
