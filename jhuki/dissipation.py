"""The :py:mod:`~.dissipation` module takes care of setting parameters for the
dissipation thorn. The main class is :py:class:`~.Dissipation`, but it is more
convenient to use helper functions to setup this object. For example, to set
up dissipation for a simulation with Lean, the simplest way is:

.. code-block:: python

   dis = add_gauge(add_Lean(create_dissipation_from_grid(grid, 0.3)))

where 0.3 is the value of ``eps_dis`` at the finest level.
