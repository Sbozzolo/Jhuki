"""The :py:mod:`~.simfactory` module provides functions to interface with
SimFactory.

The available functions are:

- :py:func:`~.simfactory_option`, which helps setting up options that are
controllable by SimFactory.

- :py:func:`~.write_parfile`, which write the `.par` file from a template
when the file is executed as `.rpar` by SimFactory.

def simfactory_option(name, default):
    """Set a variable to a SimFactory-controllable parameter.

    SimFactory can define arbitrary parameters using the ``--define`` keyword.
    With this function, you can define a variable that takes a specified default
    value, unless the keyword is used.

    For example:

    .. code-block::python

        par_b = simfactory_option("@PARB@", 6.5)

    par_b is a Python variable with the value 6.5 unless ``--define PARB=XX`` is
    passed to SimFactory. The way this works is that SimFactory performs a
    substitution of objects with the double @ symbols. For this reason, the
    name parameter to this function has to be surrounded by @.

    We convert all the numbers to floats, so if you need integers, you have to
    explicitly cast the variable to int, for example:

    .. code-block::python

        num_ref_radii = int(simfactory_option("@REFLEVELS@", 10))

    :param name: Name of the SimFactory define key. It has to be with surrounded
                 by @, for example, @XMAX@.
    :type name: str
    :param default: Default value that the variable has to have if define is not
                    specified.
    :type default: int, float, or str

    :returns: The default value if the define key is not passed to SimFactory,
              otherwise the value defined with SimFactory.
    :rtype: float or str (integers are converted)
